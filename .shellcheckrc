# Shellcheck configuration for ArchTUI
# Tells shellcheck where to find sourced scripts

# Look for sources relative to the script's directory
source-path=SCRIPTDIR

# Also check parent directory for strategies/ and tools/ subdirs
source-path=SCRIPTDIR/..

# Allow external sources that may resolve at runtime
external-sources=true

# Shell scripts use bash
shell=bash

# Disable warnings that don't affect functionality:
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately - stylistic, doesn't cause issues
# SC2034: Unused variables - many are used by sourced scripts
# SC2015: A && B || C pattern - intentional in our scripts
# SC2126: grep -c vs grep | wc -l - stylistic preference
# SC2086: Double quote variables - many intentionally unquoted for word splitting
# SC2059: Variables in printf format - intentional for dynamic formatting
# SC2005: Useless echo - sometimes needed for newlines
# SC2181: Check exit code directly - existing pattern in codebase
# SC2178: Variable used as array - bash allows this
# SC2128: Array without index - intentional first element access
# SC2269: Variable assigned to itself - initialization pattern
# SC2002: Useless cat - stylistic preference, doesn't affect functionality
# SC2329: Function never invoked - false positive for trap handlers and sourced helpers
